## Getting started

To install this module

```
# with npm
npm install --save dcc-decoder
```

## Usage

This module supports decoding DCC data from the QR data.
The module can directly load and utilise the trust list from a url provided or you can pass in the trust list, valuesets and business rules.

The response will contain the raw cert (rawCert), the populated cert (cert) using the valudset provided, an errors array that will contain any errors encountered during decoding such as invalid signatire, cert expired etc

#### Example

```javascript
import { decodeOnly, loadDCCConfigData } from 'dcc-decoder';

(async () => {
  const dcc = await loadDCCConfigData('https://url_for_config')
  const result = await decodeOnly({
          source: ['HC1:....'],
          dccData: dcc
        })
  if (result.errors) {
    console.log('Decoding error', result.errors)
  }
  console.log(result.cert)
})()
```

#### Methods

##### `loadDCCConfigData()`

```javascript
const dccData = await loadDCCConfigData('https://url_for_config')
```

Used to load the dcc config data needed to decode and validate a DCC. Returns the config.

---

##### `decodeOnly()`

```javascript
const result = await decodeOnly({source: ['HC1:....'], dccData: {dcc...}});
```

Decodes a DCC qr code. Will accept input as string. Returns a promise which includes the raw cert data, populated cert, cert type and any error.

---

##### `decodeAndValidateRules()`

```javascript
const result = await decodeAndValidateRules({source: ['HC1:....'], dccData: {dcc...}}, ruleCountry: 'IE'});
```

Decodes a DCC or Smart Health qr code and then runs the provided business rules against the DCC data. Will accept input as string. Returns a promise which includes the raw cert data, populated cert, cert type and any error.
